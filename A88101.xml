         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But that which maketh the wiſer ſort more unwilling to give too much way to religious diſputations, or rather to diſputations of Religion (eſpecially in publick) is the ſubtilty of ſome of unſound principles &amp; the ſimplicity of others of a better belief; who ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no deceipt, &amp; confiding in the ſtrength of truth, are eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with ingagements to diſpute to the greateſt diſadvantage of their cauſe, not forethinking how their adverſaries may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for aſſault; and what liberty of miſreport they will take, either to make ſhew of victory, or to ſhadow a foil; this inconvenience is obvious to an ordinary apprehenſion: But there are ſome ſtratagematicall depths, and policies of thoſe who are Maſters in the Myſteries of iniquity, both of the old

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cunning device was, of ſome of our Engliſh Sectaries about the yeare 1647. And that was a plot upon a diſpute managed in this manner; ſome of them had provoked a Miniſter (lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned enough for his time, but too young to match them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty either of caution or of contrivance) to a publick diſpute, which he accepted of: and though he acted his part as well as could be expected of one of his parts and yeares, yet he rather loſt then gained reputation to his cauſe or perſon, becauſe one of their ſide pretending himſelf till then to be of a contrary judgement to theirs, at the cloſe of the diſpute, openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his conviction and converſion to their party by the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction he had received at that diſputation; whereas it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward dicovered that he was a great Zelot to that cauſe and party in former times, which (together with the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars fore mentioned) induced me to propoſe unto my Brethren of the Miniſtry of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> when they met to ſubſcribe their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation to the Miniſters of <hi>London, Jun.</hi> 1648.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168513:12"/>of them both; but ſince the one was paſt and could not be recalled, he would ſend his warrant to prevent the other; and that it might be certainly and ſpeedily done, he put me upon it to draw up a form of prohibition of it: which I did, whereupon the parties ſerved with it deſiſted from their purpoſe. There was another diſputation more publickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken, and as I have heard agreed upon to be betwixt your two, <hi>Cov.

                  <p>Of later times, eſpecially ſince we have been divided into ſo many Sects, we have had (though the Military Sword, God be thanked, be ſheathed) a great deal of Word war; many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Challengers to publick diſpute, and ſome too teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious undertakers of them: whereof divers are in print, and ſome as worthy are not printed, as that of yours and Dr. <hi>Grew's</hi> encounter with Mr. <hi>Kiffin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knowls</hi> at <hi>Coventry.</hi> Theſe I purpoſely forbear, becauſe they are many, and the moſt of them are of one and the ſame Argument, the Baptiſm of Infants.</p>

And from our Saviours encounter with Satan, we may be directed with what weapon, chiefly, to manage our ſpiritual warfare, even with the ſword of the ſpirit, the word of God, as he did; and therewith put his enemy to flight. From the paſſionate exceſſes of ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants obſerved in this Catalogue, we may be admoniſhed of moderation and meekneſs of ſpirit; that by ſuffering our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to become rampant, we make not our Judgements to be couchant.

               </p>
               <p>The cauſes of ſo little good ſucceſs of Debates, Diſputes, Conferences, or Controverſies of Religion, betwixt parties of oppoſite opinions are divers; in ſome the prevalent power of fanſie or imagination above judgement, is the cauſe, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, whether artfiicial of reaſon, or inartificial of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, will work little upon prejudicated fancy: of the various working whereof we may read many obſervable particulars in the learned diſcourſe of <hi>Picus</hi> Earl of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> of<note n="r" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> With ſome, cuſtome is a great obſtacle againſt the receiving of truth: and thence it is that thoſe who have been trained up in untruth from their Child-hood, are with greateſt difficulty convinced of it, or converted from it. We may ſee the refractorineſs of this reſiſtance in <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10. who, when <hi>v.</hi> 12,13. a viſion was preſented unto him, ſhewing him ſeveral kinds of creatures, clean and unclean, and he had a command to <hi>kill and eat,</hi> v. 13. <hi>Not ſo</hi> v. 14. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaid he) why ſo <hi>Peter?</hi> he gives this reaſon of his refuſal, though the command came from Heaven; becauſe of his cuſtomary forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of forbidden meats, <hi>I have never eaten any thing that is common and unclean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With others<note n="s" place="margin">Prava vel honoris, vel pecuniae cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas animos diſputantium invaſit, ut tanquam in pugna ſola ſpectaretur victoria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168513:34"/>and impudence make any ſhew or appearance of victory, or outface the foil they have taken in diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Some withſtand the truth in unrighteouſneſs, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally out of hatred and diſdain of their Adverſaries, leſt it ſhould be thought, that by them they were brought to yield unto it: this was the humour of the Arch-Biſhop and Cardinal of <hi>Capua,</hi> who would yield to reform nothing, though many corruptions were diſcovered,<note n="t" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Some account it their credit to be no changelings, eſpecially in Religion; not knowing the difference betwixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and obſtinacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And oft times it falls out, that by the ſubtilty or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Diſputants, when they are ſomewhat evenly match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Auditory is kept pendulous, or irreſolute; even he, perhaps, for whoſe ſake the Diſpute or Conference was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as<note n="u" place="margin">Ille cujus cauſa in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendis Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turarum, ut cum dubitantem confirmes ad veritatem an nagis ad haereſim deverget, hoc ipſo motus, quod te videat nihil promoviſſe aequo gradu negandi &amp; defendendi, certe de pari &amp; altercatione incertior diſcedit, neſciens quem Haereticum judicet. <hi>Ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> When Conferences and Diſputations in Religion ſucceed not ſo well as good men would have them, is, becauſe they are not ordered or managed in ſuch a manner as they ſhould be; whereof I ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter, as in its p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oper place. In the mean time this good order will require, that I now obſerve, what good ſucceſs hath been the iſſue of ſome diſputations betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Devil in <hi>Iude,</hi> Chriſt and the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. By the way, ſome take <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel for Chriſts Son, for a created Angel to me it is, which I will now neither determine nor diſcuſs: and for the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168513:35"/>diſputes of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> they muſt needs have the better of their adverſaries, becauſe they were not able to reſiſt the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the Spirit by which they ſpake, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.10. not with any evidence of truth, or appearance of reaſon: yet when the truth was moſt illuſtriouſly ſet forth, ſome were ſo blinded and hardned with their own malice and envy, that they could not ſee it, or would not confeſs themſelves to be convinced by it; is, as when our Saviour had mightily and miraculouſly proved himſelf to be the Son of God by caſting out Devils, the Devil would not ſuffer his Adverſaries to acknowledge it, but ſtirred them up to impute the power of the holy Spirit to <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. And when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had a Diſputation with <hi>Arius,</hi> he would not yield that the power of Truth had prevailed, but<note n="w" place="margin">Arius in quit nulli dubium eſt quin magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis artibus Athanaſius non deſinat judicum pervertere ſenſus, &amp;c. <hi>Athanaſ.</hi> diſp. contra Arium Laodiceae, tom. 2. col. 393.</note> moſt <hi>abſurdly ſuggeſted, that he managed his cauſe by Magical Arts.</hi>

               <p>This plainly bewrayed the Jeſuites great diffidence in his crazy cauſe, and his craft to ſecure it from a due trial, which this way he knew could never be effected: and with this fallacy they have locked up their ſeduced Proſelytes in misbelief; ſo that we know not how to deal with them: for they will not hear us in any thing, unleſs we ſpeak to the point of viſibility in all ages; and if we offer to anſwer them in a readier and ſurer way, by the infallible Teſtimony of the Scriptures, they will not accept of it: yet notwithſtanding all the adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage they have had by the predominacy of their power over Perſons, Books &amp; Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to print and ſuppreſs what they pleaſe: we need not decline that way of trial out of any diſtruſt in our cauſe, ſince there
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168513:39"/>is yet ſo much upon record for us, and againſt them; that if ſuch a tedious and dilatory diſcuſſion of our differences were to be undertaken by diſpute face to face, they could be no gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the utmoſt iſſue of it, as we may well judge by Mr. <hi>Berkbeck</hi> in his Proteſtants evidences of the ſecond Edition printed this year in <hi>Folio,</hi> ſo much amended and augmented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the former in <hi>Quarto,</hi> that I take it to be the beſt Book extant in that kind.</p>
               <p>When upon deliberation a reſolution is made what ſhall be diſputed on;</p>
               <p>The next conſideration is concerning the Perſons.</p>
               <p>For the Perſons, and they are chiefly,

               <p>Firſt for the Diſputants; in them theſe four qualifications are chiefly requiſite:

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> they muſt be learned in the Learned Languages, in Arts, and Hiſtories, in Textual and Polemical Divinity; for they may in conflict be put to it, to make uſe of all the learning they have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They muſt be quick in conceipt, becauſe they muſt preſently without pauſe or ſtudy take their advantage, either of objecting or anſwering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They muſt be temperate, not paſſionate, or chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick like <hi>Coſterus</hi> the Jeſuite; for <hi>Coſterus,</hi> of whom Doctor <hi>Halls</hi> obſervation is,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hall.</hi> 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Diſputants ought to be pious, that (out of conſcience) they may prefer Verity before Victory.

               </p>
               <p>Before I diſpute upon the queſtion, ſaith Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> I deſire to know your quality and calling, whether you be a profeſſed Popiſh Prieſt or no?</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Egleſton.</hi> I am a Roman Catholick, not a Prieſt, but a Doctor of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker. <hi>I deſire then another Adverſary, ſome of the Prieſts here preſent, that we may diſpute on equal terms; I hold the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Proteſtant Preacher and Divines, more honourable then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Popiſh Prieſthood; and therefore if your Prieſts think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too good to dispute with me, you ſhall not brag that your Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are fit matches to dispute with Proteſtant Preachers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Egleſton.</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> you being a Divine, ought to give me, though a Lay-man, the beſt ſatisfaction you can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker, <hi>I am ready to give you ſatisfaction, if you come as a Layman, ought to a Divine, that is, with a deſire to hear, and to be instructed in all humility, not with a mind to contradict and oppoſe the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo they proceeded to Diſputation, as in the relation quoted in the Margin; and it may be the Doctor of Phyſick was a better Divine then the Prieſts that were preſent.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> in this reſpect might have had more juſt cauſe of diſdain, to take Mr. <hi>Only</hi> for his match, then Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> Doctor <hi>Egloston,</hi> ſince the diſparity was more betwixt them two, then betwixt a Divine that was not a Doctor, and a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor that was not a Divine.</p>
               <p>This for the qualification of the Diſputants. Now, ſecondly, for a Moderator, or Preſident, to manage the diſputation with decency and order.</p>
               <p>It is requiſite that ſome perſon of worth for wiſdom and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:168513:40"/>gravity (and if it may be alſo of power and authority, ſo that his power be not byaſſed by partiality on either ſide) be Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Moderator to mannage the diſputation with order and decency, for prevention of vain jangling and confuſion: when diſputations are national, and particularly authorized by the ſupreme power; that power commonly makes choice of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, or of Commiſſioners to preſide over the diſputation: ſo did the Emperour<note n="z" place="margin">

How it was occaſioned, undertaken, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at divers monthly meetings there.</head>
               <p>THe occaſion of the Diſputation (as it is related in Doctor <hi>Brians</hi> Letter to me, and in both his and Mr. <hi>Onley's</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles printed with, and prefixed before the printed Diſputation) was this; When the Lecture at <hi>Kenelmworth,</hi> at the Monday monthly meeting there was agreed upon by many Miniſters, and begun <hi>Decem.</hi> 1. 1655. for the ſetting up, and ſetling of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-order in Parochial Congregations. Doctor <hi>Brian,</hi> who took the firſt turn in it, held it on himſelfe the ſpace of ſix months together; the Text he treated on was <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Though I b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> abſent in the fleſh, yet am I with you in the ſpirit, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beholding your order, and the ſtedfaſtneſs of your faith in Chriſt. In my ſecond Sermon (ſaith he) I deſired any that ſhould hearme, or hear what I delivered touching the way of reforming
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168513:45"/>our Parochial Church's, which we reſolved on, if they doubted of the truth of any thing, they would ſignifie their doubts or ſcruples in writing, and I would endeavour to ſatisfie them.</hi> Accordingly a godly Brother of the Congregational way (Lieutenant <hi>Fox</hi> by name) ſent in ſundry objections to the Doctors third diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon that Text, and ſome letters paſſed betwixt them, whereof he (<hi>i.e.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>) deſired not any publication (though for parts and piety he is judged no way inferiour to Mr. <hi>Onley</hi>) but he, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> the next day openly declared his diſſent, and deſired to diſpute with the Doctor publickly upon theſe two Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether the Pariſh Aſſemblies of</hi> England <hi>generally be true viſible Churches; which Mr.</hi> O. <hi>denied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether every Brother, though no Elder, that hath received abilities from God (whereby he is enabled to preach) may publickly preach; which he affirmed;</hi> appointing me, ſaith Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Brian,</hi> to be Opponent in the firſt, and Reſpondent in the ſecond queſtion the next monthly day.</p>
               <p>It would have ſignified ſome modeſty in Mr. <hi>O.</hi> not to have appoynted Dr. <hi>Br.</hi> but to have the turns of diſpute as he would appoint them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I need not tell you</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>how many diſſwaſions I had from entring the lists with an illiterate Adverſary, as Mr.</hi> O. <hi>was taken for by many: among others this that in ſo doing, I ſhould diſparage my ſelfe, nor was there any probability of good to come of it;</hi> which it had been well, if he had heeded ſo far, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not ſo much the diſpute it ſelf, as to undertake it with ſuch an unequal oppoſite. But he argued himſelf into an acceptance of the challenge, out of ſome reaſons of piety, charity, and humility, which (as event hath proved) were miſapplyed to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> and that rather by his injurious miſdoing, then by the Doctors imprudent miſtaking. Beſides he had an inducement to adventure ſome inconveniencies by the diſpute (while but <hi>doubtful</hi>) from the experience of his conteſtation with two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts of <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kaffen,</hi> who came from thence to <hi>Coventry,</hi> with a great deal of confidence to confront Dr. <hi>Brian,</hi> and his worthy Brother Dr. <hi>Grewe</hi> in a publick diſputation: for which purpoſe, though the Magiſtrates
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168513:45"/>of the City, and at their requeſt, promiſed to lend the Town-Hall (upon the boyſterous misbehaviour both of themſelves, and of many of their followers, on the Sabbath day before the diſputation (who flocked in great numbers thither, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and encourage their Champions) they recalled their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion, &amp; for the ſame cauſe the Committee of Parliament reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there, for bade the diſpute. The 2. Doctors notwithſtanding were neceſſitated ſomewhat to Symbolize with the Anabaptiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far as to a non-obedience of their Governours therein, &amp; that rather in hope of their pardon, then in contempt of their power; becauſe the Anabaptiſts imputed theſe prohibitions, not ſo much to the prudence of the Magiſtrates, as to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Doctors to undertake the defence of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed judgment and practice: and this ſiniſter ſuggeſtion ſo far ſwayed with ſome religious perſons, that they inclined to make a Schiſme from the Church, if theſe far-fetched Fencers ſhould find none to take up the Sword and Buckler againſt them. For prevention of which ſcandal, they were publickly encountred, the truth ſo ſtrenuouſly aſſerted, and they ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted (in a very numerous Auditory) that ſuch as before were wavering, and in a manner tottering towards a revolt (if they ſhould have had cauſe to glory, that they put off their harneſs, becauſe none durſt put on any to combat with them) were throughly ſatisfied, and firmly ſetled and eſtabliſhed in the truth. The like bravadoes Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> might expect from his Thraſonical challenger, if he had not been underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his factious adherents would have triumphantly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him, that he durſt not commit his cauſe to ſuch a publick trial, and ſo they might have gained a great advantage, which might have confirmed his fellow-Sectaries, and diſſetled the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, too much addicted to liſten after novel fancies, and to like them too well. Beſides, he might have good hope alſo that the ſucceſs of a diſputation at <hi>Kentlmworth</hi> would be ſuch, as there was of that at <hi>Coventry.</hi> And ſo the day prefixed to begin the diſputation being come, nine Arguments were brought by the Doctor, in vindication of the Affirmative in the firſt Queſtion; and when half the time was ſpent in debate of the two firſt, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> (as himſelfe ſaith) moved for the reſt of the time to oppoſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168513:46"/>in the ſecond queſtion, which was granted only with a motion of reading the other ſeven in the Congregation: whereto Mr. <hi>O</hi> conſented, deſiring a copy of the Arguments undiſputed of, to return an anſwer to be likewiſe publickly read the next mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was Monday month after; according to which, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> drew up, as he ſaith, a Reply, and read it in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>

                  <hi>CAAP. VIII.</hi> Of the printing of the Diſputation. By whoſe motion it was made. By whom, and how managed.</head>
               <p>IMmediately after what Mr. <hi>O.</hi> had drawn up was read, a Gentleman then preſent, deſired that the Diſputation might be printed, and deſired Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to move it to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, which he did; whereto he replied, if he might reply he was willing: but ſaid withal, that he had twelve Arguments more in proof of the queſtion: to which I replyed (ſaith Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) I was contented he ſhould reply to mine anſwer to the nine firſt without any rejoynder, provided I might anſwer to the twelve laſt without his reply, onely till they were printed; and then each ſhould be at liberty to write what he pleaſed. To this motion of printing the Doctor yielded in the cloſe of the third or fourth dayes diſputation. <hi>viz.</hi> that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Anſwers, Replyes, and Rejoynders might be put in print, and (for his proviſo) Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> gave him liberty to oppoſe what he pleaſed, and take in alſo the help of Mr. <hi>Marley,</hi> and thoſe other ſeven who aſſiſted him in diſputation, that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt he and they could object further againſt our Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, might come under one view: and withal, <hi>the Doctor wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to forbear in ſtead of arguing, to make any more excurſions by tedious and impertinent declamations againſt our Miniſters and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168513:46"/>Members, wherein all your anſwers</hi> (ſaith he to Mr. <hi>O.) for the moſt part ſpend themſelves.</hi> So in the Epiſtle of Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> I have related the more out of both their printed Teſtimonies, touching the diſputation and impreſsion of it, becauſe the printed book is very hard to come by, though Mr. <hi>O.</hi> ſaith it was publiſhed with both their conſents, which may be very much doubted of for divers reaſons. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, there were no publick Notaries and Witneſſes, to write and atteſt what paſſed in diſpute betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though there were copies taken of the diſpute, the chief pen-man of the whole was Mr. <hi>O.</hi> who<note n="(a)" place="margin">In the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putat. p. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>confeſſith, by reaſon of a mighty crowd of people he could hardly breathe, or write one perfect ſentence of Doctor</hi> Brians <hi>Sermon:</hi> and there might be as much difficulty in taking by his pen other Dictates deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by word. The crowd it is like was very great, for Dr. <hi>Brian</hi> ſpeaking of ſeven which took Mr. <hi>O.</hi> his part in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, who were <hi>Antipedobaptists;</hi> he in his anſwer ſaith,<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>J. O.</hi> in his Exam. of the Doctors Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. p. 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>he believeth there was ſeven times ſeven thrice told that took his part,</hi> that is 149. and I believe for one ſuch a one, there was 20. at leaſt of a contrary judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But if there were a perfect copy of the Diſpute made up by the Doctor and him, that copy was committed to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> his hand to be promoted to the Preſs, and no copy kept, whereby it might be known to be truely printed: ſuch was the Doctors candid and ſuſpectleſs dealing with his adverſary, which laid a great engagement upon him, of fair and ingenuous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with him again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When the book was printed, he ſhould have ſent the Doctor a copy of it, before he had printed his Letter of conſent unto it, that he might allow or diſallow it, as he ſhould ſee cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> having the Manuſcript in his own hands, might have altered his own part for the better, the Doctors for the worſe at his pleaſure. And that he had a mind to magnifie himſelf, and diſgrace the Doctor all he could, is plain, both by the book of the diſputation, and by his latter book of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Doctors Reply. For the former, it may appear to any indifferent Reader, that for a good part of the Book,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168513:47"/>from the beginning (wherin Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> is Opponent) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the promptneſs of a ready Text-man, and the acumen of a Polemick School-man, as his aſſiduous and unceſſant (yet very powerful) preaching, ſheweth him an excellent Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: But in the relation of the latter part of the Book Mr. <hi>O.</hi> ſo enervateth the vigour of his diſcourſe, as if he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a failing of his faculties, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did when his locks were ſhorn. And this he did that he might have more hope to appear a conqueror in the conflict. To which end he contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Doctors Speeches, and enlargeth his own after what ſize he pleaſeth: ſo that he neither doth, nor can acknowledg he hath done him right in the printed Edition of that diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And who that knoweth his eminent abilities for quickneſs of conceit, ſoundneſs of judgement, and livelineſs of ſpirit, and volubility of ſpeech, can imagine that he would ſuffer Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to enlarge his anſwer to his ninth Argument, of leſs then four lines, to well towards forty; and in that anſwer to ſum up the Diſpute into a Triumphant Compendium for his own reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Doctors reproach, without one word of Reply for himſelf or his cauſe? As in this printed diſputation he hath done him little right, ſo in the other Book he hath done him a great deal of wrong, for not being contented to magnifie his own performance, with a maſterſhip in the Diſpute, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſets it forth (when it had been honour enough for him, in that Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> accepted of him for his Antagoniſt, though he had ſubmitted to him as his convert) he publiſhed another Book as an examination of the Doctors Reply; wherein he took a great deal more liberty to traduce him. But that which I will obſerve at preſent, is his unworthy dealing with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, in the publication of thoſe two Books: for becauſe he could not for ſhame but publiſh ſomething in the diſpute, which might appear anſwerable to Dr. <hi>Brians</hi> deſerved eſtimation (for otherwiſe hundreds would have accuſed him as a falſary) that book of the diſpute was rather ſuppreſſed, then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſold; for ſo ſoon as I heard that it was to be printed, I wrote to my Stationer for it, and remembred him of it with much importunity many times for many weeeks and months together, to procure one for me; and though he uſed his beſt endeavour
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168513:47"/>and diligence to that purpoſe, he ſtill returned a <hi>non est inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> for that book: but ſo ſoon as I heard of Mr. <hi>O.</hi> his ſecond book, and ſent for it, I received it by the firſt return of the Carrier afterward: the readieſt reaſon of which difference I conceive to be this, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> his falſhood in the former Book, might more eaſily be diſcovered then in the latter; and his honour to the Doctors diſhonour in the later was more ſet forth, then in the former. In the publication whereof, beſides the offenſive Contents of it, he gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> cauſe of complaint, in that this later Book againſt him (much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him then the former, becauſe it was much more contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious and inſolent) had been abroad a long time, before he had any notice thereof. Truely whatſoever Mr. <hi>O.</hi> thinketh of his own omiſſion herein (and it may be his deſire was, that he of all men ſhould never have ſeen it) I could not but take it for a part of ingenuity and juſtice (when my caſe was like his) to give as timely intelligence as I could, of what I had publiſhed againſt his Friend mine Adverſary Mr. <hi>S.</hi> by leaving one of my Books with his Stationer <hi>G. C.</hi> ſo ſoon as it came from the Preſs, to be ſent to him with ſpeed: and ſo I dealt with Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>H.</hi> for (having received ſome copies of my firſt Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, firſt of all upon Friday night) I ſent my ſervant with one to him the next Saturday following.</p>

               <p>I will note but one thing more of his ignorance, and that is a probability that he cannot be learned, from his condition and courſe of life; for as one of his diſciples told Doctor <hi>Brian,</hi> and the Doctor wrote unto me in his Letter, <hi>March</hi> 6.16.56, <hi>He painfully follows Husbandry all the Week dayes, and preacheth to a congregation of Anabaptiſts and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliſts on the Sabbath.</hi>

               <p>For the firſt; if ſince God layd the Law upon <hi>Adam, that in the ſweat of his face he ſhall eat bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. it hath been unlawful for one man, eſpecially for Miniſters, to live by the labours of the people, why did God maintain his worſhip by the Miniſtry of the Levites in that manner all along the old Teſtament? and if it be unlawful under the new Teſtament for Evangelical Miniſters to be corporally ſupported by thoſe who are ſpiritually inſtructed by them; why did the Apoſtle ſay, 1 Cor. 9.11. <hi>If we have ſowen unto you ſpiritual things, is it much, if we reap your carnal things?</hi> And doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, the King himſelf is ſerved by the field, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5 9. and yet he doth not, nor is it fit he ſhould put his hand to the plow as you do? nay it is ſo far from being a fault, to live by the labour of another, that we muſt one labour for another, in one kind or other: and there is a ſweat of the brain as well as of the brow; And you, methinks Mr. <hi>O.</hi> ſhould experimentally know them both to be painful, and that of the brain more painful of the two, unleſs you preach by <hi>Enthuſiaſme,</hi> without any ſtudy: for of the ſleep of a labouring man, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, it is ſweet, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5 12. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the bodily labour: but the labour of the brain will not ſuffer; and the fault is not for a King or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, or a Judge, or a Warriour, a Miniſter, or an Artificer to live by the ſweat of the Husbandmans brows; for without his labour no ſociety of men could ſubſiſt: but to live idle like a Drone among the Bees, to take no pains for his living; for ſuch idle perſons ſhould not live by the Apoſtles ſentence; <hi>when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.10. This for Mr. <hi>O.</hi> his <hi>Theſis;</hi> now for his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> as to Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> compared with himſelfe; he is not (ſaith he) maintained like Doctor <hi>Brian, with the ſweat of other mens brows,</hi> if he mean that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth idle, ſo as not to deſerve his maintenance of thoſe for whom he labours, he knows neither his worth nor his work: if he did, and were (as he is) an Adverſary, and as ſuch an one, would not withhold the truth in unrighteouſneſs, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. he would confeſs him as able, as painful, powerful and profitable a Miniſter (no diſparagement to any) as any of his knowledge this day in <hi>England,</hi> and well worthy of a far more liberal ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               </p>
               <p>The next ill quality which I ſhall note in Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is his <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,</hi> whereof I will give three Teſtimonies in ſtead of many more, which I might produce out of his examination of the Doctors Reply; one at the beginning of it in his Epiſtle, as he ſtileth it, <hi>To the impartial Reader,</hi> to which it might be truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>From a moſt partial Writer:</hi> There he ſpeaketh much againſt Epiſtolary prejudice, to make the Readers to reject the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Writer oppoſeth, when himſelf is ſo forward to commit the ſame fault, that he is guilty of it in the Title page, where he anticipateth the Readers judgement of the cauſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be heard) with notorious calumnies of his adverſaries part of the difference and egregious flatteries of his own in theſe words which I have cited in part<note n="*" place="margin">At pag. 126.</note> before under another
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168513:56"/>Title, and to another purpoſe: but in this place it will not be impertinent to ſet forth more fully his malignant partiality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctor</hi> Brians <hi>Reply to the Anſwer of his ten firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, levied</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to prove the Pariſhes of this Nation true Churches, Examined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The invalidity of all his anſwers, his ſophiſtical helps, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſelf-contradicting allegations are preſented to himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the clearer diſcovery of the Popiſh, Political, Antichriſtian, and like preſent conſtitution of the Parochial Aſſemblies of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having yet never been true Churches from their very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor poſſible to be made true by Reformation, having had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet any true Geſpel-conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As alſo the Antichriſtian Call, Entrance, Doctrine, &amp;c. of the National Ministry in part unvailed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With a Confirmation of ſome of thoſe precious Apoſtolical truths, ſo vehemently cried down as Heretical, ſo far as directly or occaſionally there was way made for their vindication; By</hi> J.

               <p>That which in all this is principally now to be noted is his palpable partiality, and moſt apparent contradiction betwixt the contents of his Title page, and his Epiſtle to the Reader: but withall, I might obſerve many groſs untruths, both againſt the Doctor and the Churches, owned and defended by him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Call, Entrance, and Doctrine of the National Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which he calleth Antichriſtian; when, for ought I can perceive by the printed Diſputation, or his Examination, he doth not know who is Antichriſt, or what is Antichriſtian. But
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:168513:57"/>theſe are met withal elſewhere in this diſcourſe, as juſt occaſion required. For the preſent I ſhall only commend unto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this obſervation of Mr. <hi>John Onley</hi> and his adherents, <hi>viz.</hi> that moſt indiſcreetly and abſurdly they uſually renounce that which in the Romaniſts is agreeable to the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Conſcience, and Scripture, as Popiſh and Antithriſtian, as I have already ſhewed in this Chapter, and agree with them in that which is truely popiſh and Antichriſtian, as Error, Pride, Schiſme, Cenſoriouſneſs, Malice, Slander, ſophiſtical Subtilty, as their writings and doings do declare, eſpecially Mr. <hi>J. O.</hi> in his dealing with Doctor <hi>Brian,</hi> in his unfaithful publication of the diſputation at <hi>Kenelmworth,</hi> and in his other bitter and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Book of Examination afterward.</p>
               <p>The ſecond proof of his partiality is this; when Doctor <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> hath proved our Churches of <hi>England</hi> to be true Churches of Chriſt by convincing arguments;<note place="margin">Nam quae non proſunt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, juncta valent.

                  </gap>) all that avails nothing towards Mr. <hi>O.</hi> his ſatisfaction, unleſs he prove an impertinency to the Queſtion, <hi>viz. That they were true Churches from their very foundation, that is, as he explaineth himſelf more fully elſewhere, that all the pariſhes of this Nation, in their first diviſion into Pariſhes were viſible Saints, and that thoſe Churches gathered by preaching onely</hi> 500.<note place="margin">Exam. of Dr. <hi>Br.</hi> Reply. p. 30, 37. Ibid. p. 24. Diſp. p. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>years before</hi> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine <hi>the Monk, were ſuch as our Pariſhes now are, or that they are ſuch now, as they were then: and this he maketh the life of the Doctors cauſe; and if he prove not this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he doth nothing,</hi> whereas it is neither the life nor limb of his cauſe; no, neither hair nor nail of it; neither a skirt nor an hem: but indeed meet nothing to the purpoſe. And therefore the Doctor did juſtly and diſcreetly decline it as impertinent, ſaying, it is our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches preſent, not their primitive ſtate which I undertake to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate; and this upon very good reaſon. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Churches, whoſe primitive conſtitution was the beſt and neareſt to that of the Apoſtler, both in time, matter, and form, as that of <hi>Jeruſalem, Rome, Antioch,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> long ſince are fallen from the faith, and have unchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched themſelves by their Apoſtaſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is but a Jeſuitical evaſion from the pertinency and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168513:57"/>life of the cauſe of a true Chriſtian Church, to wave the preſent qualifications and notes of it, and to put all the weight and ſtreſs of the trial upon the Hiſtorical report of precedent times; as while we prove our Church to be a true Church, and our Faith a true Faith by the Scriptures, as Doctor <hi>Featley</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuite, that would be taken for no good proof with him, unleſs he deduced the viſibility of the Proteſtant Profeſſors, through all ages from the Apoſtles to <hi>Luthers</hi> time; and he profeſſed he would not proceed in the diſpute, unleſs that were firſt done, as is obſerved before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it were pertinent, and were alſo proved by Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological Hiſtory, it would ſerve but to make up a meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Hiſtorical Faith, which is not effectual to Salvation; and the doubt of it where it is required and not proved (as it is no eaſie matter to do) may raiſe perplexing doubts and fears of ſalvation in weak, though well-minded Chriſtians; as cauſing ſuſpicious conceits of their being in a true Church, out of which, as out of <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark (the common ſaying is) none are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Yet this unſound and groundleſs aſſertion of his, which hath neither proof of Scripture, Reaſon, or of any humane Author of credit or account, be not onely putteth into the very front of his Examination <hi>(frontinulla fides)</hi> but repeateth it over and over, both in the Diſputation and Examination, to puzzle the ſimple Hearers of the one, and Readers of both;<note place="margin">Diſp. p. 1, 6, 7, 12. Exam. p. 11, 12, 13, 24, 27, 28, 30, 37.</note> and to make them believe that there was ſomewhat in it, which made the Doctor afraid to meddle with it; whereas it was a meer extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy from the queſtion in hand, which to ſuch as are intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, ſhews Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to be a Jeſuitical ſhifter; and that he may appear more and worſe then a Jeſuite, he taketh upon him to be a Pope, peremptorily defining <hi>tanquam ex Cathedra Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiae,</hi> not only that our Churches have never been true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the foundation of them, but that it is not poſſible for them to be made true by reformation. Thus in the Title page of his Examination, wherein his ignorance, confidence, and imprudence are all of them ſuperlative, and worthy of none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer then a ſcornful ſilence.</p>
               <p>Yet the other part of his partiality which now I am to prove,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168513:58"/>will implicitly at leaſt confute it fully; for he that is ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to impoſe upon the Doctor ſuch an impertinency, as <hi>the life of his cauſe,</hi> and to regard none of his proofs, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo pregnant, for the truth of our Churches, is ſo gracious to his own ſide, as to reſolve that a true Church may be conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted thus, <hi>A company of true Believers aſſembled in the Name of Christ, willing to follow him in the way of his ordinances revealed in his word, and yet ſeeing their want of a perſonal ſucceſſion, and yet knowing it their duty, and the will of Chriſt, it ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, did appoint one that was unbaptized to reaſſume and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot this ordinance of Chriſt.</hi> And if ſo, how partial is Mr. <hi>O.</hi> who makes it impoſſible for our Churches to be made true by any reformation? for how eaſie a matter is it for Churches to be reformed after that manner?</p>
               <p>The third partiality of Mr. <hi>O.</hi> appeareth in his Epiſtle to his Schiſmatical Siſter-Churches, where he taketh upon him to make a long Paraphraſe on the words of <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> Acts 22.18. but when Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> makes but a ſhort one on the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is made to you and to your Children: ſaying, if the promiſe be made to believers and their children, the command muſt reach not only to them but to their children, as running thus, be baptized you and your children, for the promiſe is made to you and to your children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in a jeering manner replye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

But if Doctor <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ian</hi> had been worthy, and had taken upon him to play the Dictator, he had acted that part a great deal better, by deducing Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme from the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> then Mr. <hi>O.</hi> did, dictating ſuch an Aphoriſm out of his own fancy, concerning neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the primitive conſtitution of a Church, to prove it to be a true Church at preſent, which we have now examined and refuted.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:168513:58"/>
               <p>The fourth partiality I ſhall mention is this; he will not be turned over by Dr. <hi>Brian</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> for ſatisfaction concerning the name Pariſh, and parochial precincts;<note place="margin">Exam p. 22, 23. Diſp. p. 48.</note> yet in a matter of greater difficulty (as the ſetting up of Church-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances by an unbapt zed perſon) he turns his Reader over to an obſcure Treatiſe, entitled, <hi>The way to Zion:</hi> and Doctor <hi>Brian</hi> citing Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> 27 Arguments for Church-memberſhip, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> puts him off with Mr. <hi>Fiſhers</hi> Reply,<note place="margin">Exam. p. 128.</note> in his imagination proving the contrary, where he hath this ill hap to make his reference, and to beſtow a commendable Epithet upon a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker (for ſuch an one is Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> now become) and as ſuch an one Mr. <hi>O.</hi> muſt be a ſharp adverſary againſt him,<note place="margin">Epiſt. p. 15, 16, 17.

But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a more rational, religious, ſound, and ſetled Divine, then that there can be any fear at all that he will ever turn or become ſo wretched a changeling.</p>
               <p>I will take but one exception more out of the two Books of his publication, and that is concerning the Civil Magiſtrate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the exerciſe of whoſe authority in matters of Religion he often uttereth his diſlike, eſpecially as it is aſſiſtant to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Miniſterial function; whereof I will mention but one paſſage of ſome importance,<note place="margin">Exam. p. 53. margin.</note> though it be with him but in a Marginal note, which is this; <hi>[The Sword of the Magiſtrate being your beſt relief, without which I think you would live but a while.]</hi> Whereof his meaning may be, that their authority maintains the Miniſters publick maintenance, without which they could not ſubſiſt.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168513:60"/>he wants the books you direct him to, or will not be at coſt to buy them, or trouble to peruſe them; and if he did read them, would bring a reſolution rather to cavil at them, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive reſolution from them.
